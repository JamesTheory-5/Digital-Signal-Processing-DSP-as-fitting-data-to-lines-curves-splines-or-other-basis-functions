Perfect — let’s build a **conceptual and mathematical overview** of your idea:
reformulating **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** as **fitting data to lines, curves, splines, or other basis functions**.
We’ll treat DSP as a *theory of function approximation on discrete domains.*

## 🧭 1. Conceptual Overview

### 1.1. DSP as Function Approximation

A **signal** ( x[n] ) is a sequence of samples from some (possibly unknown) continuous function ( x(t) ).
DSP’s purpose — filtering, analysis, reconstruction, compression — can all be reframed as:

> **Finding or operating on a best-fitting function** ( \hat{x}(t) ) that approximates the observed samples ( x[n] ).

That "best-fitting" function could come from various **basis families**:

| Family     | Example Basis Function | Domain       | Interpretation            |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Polynomial | ( t^k )                | Local        | Fit with lines/parabolas  |
| Fourier    | ( e^{j\omega t} )      | Global       | Fit with sinusoids        |
| Wavelet    | ( \psi_{a,b}(t) )      | Localized    | Fit with scaled waveforms |
| Spline     | ( B_m(t) )             | Local/Global | Fit with smooth segments  |
| FIR Filter | ( h[k] )               | Discrete     | Fit via convolution       |

Each DSP method chooses a **basis** (the “curves” you fit) and a **projection rule** (the fitting criterion).

## 🧩 2. Mathematical Overview

### 2.1. Signal as a Vector in Function Space

We can represent a discrete-time signal ( x[n] ) as a vector in a Hilbert space ( \mathcal{H} = \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}) ),
or a continuous-time function ( x(t) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) ).

The key idea: any function (or signal) can be represented as a **linear combination of basis functions**:
[
x(t) = \sum_{k} c_k , \phi_k(t)
]
where ( \phi_k(t) ) are basis functions (lines, sinusoids, splines, etc.) and ( c_k ) are coefficients.

DSP operations — convolution, filtering, transforms — can then be viewed as **finding or manipulating these coefficients**.

---

### 2.2. The Fitting Problem

Given discrete samples ( x[n] ), we want to find coefficients ( c_k ) such that:
[
\hat{x}(t) = \sum_{k} c_k , \phi_k(t)
]
best fits ( x[n] ).

We can define this as a **least squares problem**:
[
\min_{c_k} \sum_{n} \left( x[n] - \sum_{k} c_k , \phi_k(nT) \right)^2
]
where ( T ) is the sampling period.

This is a general fitting formulation — DSP is about doing this *efficiently and systematically.*

---

### 2.3. Classical DSP as Basis Fitting

#### (a) **Fourier Transform**

Use sinusoidal bases:
[
\phi_k(t) = e^{j 2\pi k t / N}
]
Then:
[
c_k = \langle x, \phi_k \rangle = \sum_n x[n] e^{-j2\pi k n / N}
]
This is simply **projection onto complex exponential bases** — a fitting process in the frequency domain.

---

#### (b) **Filtering and Convolution**

Filtering with impulse response ( h[n] ):
[
y[n] = (x * h)[n] = \sum_k x[k] h[n - k]
]
This can be interpreted as fitting each point ( y[n] ) to a *weighted combination* of neighboring data —
i.e. **local fitting with fixed weights**.

The **Savitzky–Golay filter** makes this interpretation explicit — it computes ( y[n] ) as the value of a *local polynomial least-squares fit*.

---

#### (c) **Spline Reconstruction**

Suppose we use spline bases ( \phi(t) = B_m(t) ) (a B-spline of degree ( m )):
[
\hat{x}(t) = \sum_n c[n] B_m(t - n)
]
To determine the coefficients ( c[n] ), we solve:
[
x[k] = \sum_n c[n] B_m(k - n)
]
This is a **discrete convolution equation**:
[
x = c * B_m
]
To find ( c ), apply the inverse filter:
[
c = x * B_m^{-1}
]
Hence spline fitting is equivalent to **filtering** —
and **B-spline filtering** is DSP with spline bases instead of sinusoids.

---

### 2.4. Unified Framework

All of these can be written in the same abstract form:
[
x = \Phi c
]
where:

* ( \Phi ) is a matrix (or operator) whose columns are samples of basis functions,
* ( c ) are coefficients,
* ( x ) are signal samples.

DSP operations then correspond to:

* **Transformations:** ( c = \Phi^T x ) (Fourier, wavelet)
* **Filtering:** ( y = Hx = \Phi W \Phi^{-1} x )
* **Interpolation:** ( \hat{x}(t) = \Phi_t c )

This is literally the **linear algebra of function fitting**.

---

## 🧠 3. Geometric Interpretation

In the Hilbert space picture:

* The signal ( x ) is a **vector**.
* Basis functions form **directions** (axes).
* Filtering = **projection** or **rotation** within that space.
* DSP design = choosing bases that make meaningful structure “linear” and easily separable.

For example:

* Fourier basis diagonalizes convolution (turns filtering into multiplication),
* Wavelet bases localize structure,
* Spline bases preserve smoothness and continuity.

## 🔗 5. Summary Insight

DSP can be reformulated as:

> “The study of representing, transforming, and reconstructing discrete data as projections onto structured basis functions — from lines and polynomials to sinusoids and splines.”

This connects:

* **Fourier analysis** → harmonic fitting
* **Filtering** → local regression
* **Spline interpolation** → smooth curve fitting
* **Wavelet analysis** → multiresolution fitting

All as parts of **one unified functional approximation framework**.
